A personal website with four pages—index.html, about.html, interests.html, and contact.html—is the result of this project. 
It has a table, responsive design, Bootstrap integration, and a navigation bar. 
The visual appeal is improved with SCSS features and CSS style. 
To preview the website, just open the HTML files in the browser of your choice.
